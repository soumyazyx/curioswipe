# üß± CurioSwipe ‚Äì Project Overview

> **Note:** This project is being used as a learning pad by a beginner (absolute zero experience) in Android app development. All steps, explanations, and troubleshooting are written with that context in mind. 
>
> **Development Context:**
> - Code is developed and executed on a remote Linux (Oracle OCI) VM, accessed via SSH from a Windows laptop running VS Code.
> - The user may want to run the app on a local Android device or emulator on their Windows machine, not on the remote Linux box.
>
> Please provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for every next action, considering this setup.

CurioSwipe is a mobile application that delivers swipeable, curiosity-driven topics (randomized or interest-based), optionally with text-to-speech audio playback. Designed to be used while commuting ‚Äî even with Android Auto ‚Äî it's a "snackable curiosity companion" built for modern users.

## üîπ Backend

- **Framework**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)  
- **API Layer**: Django REST Framework (DRF)  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Key Features**:
  - Admin dashboard out of the box
  - Token-auth-enabled API endpoints
  - ORM for easy DB access
  - Swagger endpoint exists at `/swagger/` but is currently not functional.

---

## üîπ Database

- **Engine**: Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)
- **Schemas**:
  - `curioswipe_dev` ‚Äì development and testing (created)
  - `curioswipe_prod` ‚Äì production usage (created)
- **Driver**: [`oracledb`](https://pypi.org/project/oracledb/) (preferred) or `cx_Oracle`
- **Why Oracle?**:
  - Already in use (e.g., trivia app)
  - High performance
  - Avoids SQLite/PostgreSQL switching

---

## üîπ Hosting

- **Cloud Provider**: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- **Environment**:
  - ARM-based Compute instance (Ubuntu)
  - Oracle ADB integrated
- **Deployment Plan**:
  - Local testing using Django dev server
  - Future move to `gunicorn + nginx` for production

---

## üîπ Android Mobile App

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Networking**: Retrofit or Ktor
- **Audio**: Android Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- **Key Goals**:
  - Swipeable UI for topics
  - Interest selection screen
  - Android Auto compatibility (voice playback mode)

---

## üîπ Android Mobile App (NEW)

- **Project created in Android Studio (June 2025)**
- **Location**: `mobile/` folder in the repo
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose (selected during project setup)
- **Build**: Initial build successful in Android Studio
- **Setup**: Project opened in a dedicated Android Studio window for focused development
- **Next Steps**:
  - Explore project structure and understand key files
  - Run the default app on an emulator or device
  - Plan integration with backend API

---

## üî∏ Optional Future Enhancements

- **Personalization**:
  - User interest categories
  - Geo-location relevance
  - Context-aware curation
- **External Content Sources**:
  - Wikipedia / Wikidata
  - News APIs
  - OpenAI APIs (for summarization or generation)
- **Analytics**: Basic usage tracking

## üö¶ Current Status

- Django backend project scaffolded under `backend/curioswipe/`.
- Dev server accessible on port `9003` and confirmed accessible via `http://129.154.40.152:9003/`.
- Oracle Autonomous Database schemas (`curioswipe_dev` and `curioswipe_prod`) are created and integrated.
- All migrations applied successfully; new tables verified using SQL Developer.
- `.env` file added for secure storage of database credentials.
- `settings.py` updated to dynamically load environment variables using `environ`.
- Dependencies installed from `requirements.txt` to ensure compatibility.
- API endpoints implemented for `topics` and `categories` with full CRUD functionality.
- **Android app project initialized in `mobile/` and ready for development.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Mobile App Development**
   - Scaffold the Android app using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
   - Integrate Retrofit or Ktor for API communication.

2. **Backend Enhancements**
   - Add token-based authentication for API endpoints.
   - Implement filtering and pagination for `/api/topics/` and `/api/categories/` endpoints.

3. **Testing**
   - Perform end-to-end testing between the backend and mobile app.
   - Verify API responses and database interactions.

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md and tech-stack.md with recent changes.
   - Document API usage and endpoints for developers.

## ‚úÖ Initial Setup

**Ingress Rule:**  
*For development servers, we are using 9000 series ports - like 9001, 9002.  
So, selected 9003 port for curioswipe development server*  
**Steps to Add Ingress Rule for Port 9003 in OCI**  
‚Üí Log in to Oracle Cloud Console ‚Üí Sign in  
‚Üí Navigate to Compute ‚Üí Instances  
‚Üí Find and click on your instance (the one with IP `129.154.40.152`).  
‚Üí Find the Primary VNIC  
‚Üí In the instance details, look for the "Primary VNIC" and click on it.  
‚Üí Go to Subnet Details ‚Üí In the VNIC details, click on the subnet name (this will take you to the subnet details).  
‚Üí Find Security Lists ‚Üí In the subnet details, you‚Äôll see a section for "Security Lists".  
‚Üí Click on the security list name (usually something like `Default Security List for ...`).  
‚Üí Add Ingress Rule ‚Üí Refer screenshots below

- **Configure IPTABLES on VM**  
    ```
    ubuntu@whatever:~/projects/curioswipe/backend$ sudo iptables -I INPUT   -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 9003 -j ACCEPT 
    ```
- **Python Environment:**  
    ```
    python3 -m venv backend/venv
    source backend/venv/bin/activate
    pip install django djangorestframework oracledb
    ```

- **Django Project Scaffold:**  
    ```
    source backend/venv/bin/activate
    django-admin startproject curioswipe backend/curioswipe
    python backend/manage.py migrate
    ```

- **Settings:**  
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` in `backend/curioswipe/settings.py`

- **Run Dev Server:**  
    ```
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9003
    ```
    Access the page via: http://129.154.40.152:9003/

## üîπ Oracle ADB Schemas

- `curioswipe_dev` and `curioswipe_prod` schemas have been created in Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) with password `Offline@1235`.
- Both have been granted CONNECT, RESOURCE, and object creation privileges.

### üóíÔ∏è Executed Oracle SQL Commands

The following SQL commands were executed to set up the schemas and privileges:

```sql
-- Create development user/schema
CREATE USER curioswipe_dev IDENTIFIED BY "Offline@1235"
DEFAULT TABLESPACE data
QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO curioswipe_dev;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE PROCEDURE TO curioswipe_dev;

-- Create production user/schema
CREATE USER curioswipe_prod IDENTIFIED BY "Offline@1235";

ALTER USER curioswipe_prod DEFAULT TABLESPACE data;
ALTER USER curioswipe_prod QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO curioswipe_prod;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE PROCEDURE TO curioswipe_prod;
```
