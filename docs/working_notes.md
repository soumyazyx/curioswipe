# CurioSwipe ‚Äì Working Notes

### **Current Status**
1. **Backend:**
   - Django project scaffolded under curioswipe.
   - Development server is running on port `9003` and accessible via `http://129.154.40.152:9003/`.
   - Oracle Autonomous Database schemas (`curioswipe_dev` and `curioswipe_prod`) are created and integrated.
   - All migrations applied successfully; new tables verified using SQL Developer.
   - `.env` file added for secure storage of database credentials.
   - `settings.py` updated to dynamically load environment variables using `environ`.
   - Dependencies installed from `requirements.txt` to ensure compatibility.
   - No API endpoints or models have been implemented yet.

2. **Mobile App:**
   - Planned to use Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for UI and Retrofit/Ktor for networking.
   - No code for the mobile app has been implemented yet.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Tech stack and working notes are well-documented.
   - Clear roadmap and project structure outlined.

## ‚úÖ Initial Setup

**Ingress Rule:**  
*For development servers, we are using 9000 series ports - like 9001, 9002.  
So, selected 9003 port for curioswipe development server*  
**Steps to Add Ingress Rule for Port 9003 in OCI**  
‚Üí Log in to Oracle Cloud Console ‚Üí Sign in  
‚Üí Navigate to Compute ‚Üí Instances  
‚Üí Find and click on your instance (the one with IP `129.154.40.152`).  
‚Üí Find the Primary VNIC  
‚Üí In the instance details, look for the "Primary VNIC" and click on it.  
‚Üí Go to Subnet Details ‚Üí In the VNIC details, click on the subnet name (this will take you to the subnet details).  
‚Üí Find Security Lists ‚Üí In the subnet details, you‚Äôll see a section for "Security Lists".  
‚Üí Click on the security list name (usually something like `Default Security List for ...`).  
‚Üí Add Ingress Rule ‚Üí Refer screenshots below

- **Configure IPTABLES on VM**  
    ```
    ubuntu@whatever:~/projects/curioswipe/backend$ sudo iptables -I INPUT   -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 9003 -j ACCEPT 
    ```
- **Python Environment:**  
    ```
    python3 -m venv backend/venv
    source backend/venv/bin/activate
    pip install django djangorestframework oracledb
    ```

- **Django Project Scaffold:**  
    ```
    source backend/venv/bin/activate
    django-admin startproject curioswipe backend/curioswipe
    python backend/manage.py migrate
    ```

- **Settings:**  
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` in `backend/curioswipe/settings.py`

- **Run Dev Server:**  
    ```
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9003
    ```
    Access the page via: http://129.154.40.152:9003/

## üîπ Oracle ADB Schemas

- `curioswipe_dev` and `curioswipe_prod` schemas have been created in Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) with password `Offline@1235`.
- Both have been granted CONNECT, RESOURCE, and object creation privileges.

### üóíÔ∏è Executed Oracle SQL Commands

The following SQL commands were executed to set up the schemas and privileges:

```sql
-- Create development user/schema
CREATE USER curioswipe_dev IDENTIFIED BY "Offline@1235"
DEFAULT TABLESPACE data
QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO curioswipe_dev;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE PROCEDURE TO curioswipe_dev;

-- Create production user/schema
CREATE USER curioswipe_prod IDENTIFIED BY "Offline@1235";

ALTER USER curioswipe_prod DEFAULT TABLESPACE data;
ALTER USER curioswipe_prod QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO curioswipe_prod;
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE PROCEDURE TO curioswipe_prod;
```

## üö¶ Current Status

- Django backend project scaffolded under `backend/curioswipe/`.
- Dev server accessible on port `9003` and confirmed accessible via `http://129.154.40.152:9003/`.
- Oracle Autonomous Database schemas (`curioswipe_dev` and `curioswipe_prod`) are created and integrated.
- All migrations applied successfully; new tables verified using SQL Developer.
- `.env` file added for secure storage of database credentials.
- `settings.py` updated to dynamically load environment variables using `environ`.
- Dependencies installed from `requirements.txt` to ensure compatibility.
- No API endpoints or models have been implemented yet

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Database Integration**
   - Configure Django to use Oracle Autonomous Database (`curioswipe_dev` schema)
   - Test DB connection with oracledb driver

2. **API Scaffold**
   - Add Django REST Framework to `INSTALLED_APPS`
   - Create a `topics` app for topic models and endpoints
   - Build a basic `/api/topic/` endpoint

3. **Admin Setup**
   - Register models for admin dashboard

4. **Testing**
   - Verify API and DB connectivity locally
