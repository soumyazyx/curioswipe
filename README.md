# 🧠 CurioSwipe

**Discover one swipe at a time.**  
CurioSwipe is a curiosity-first Android app that presents bite-sized, thought-provoking topics based on your interests and context — perfect for your commute or spare moments.

## 🎯 Purpose

CurioSwipe is designed to make learning frictionless and fun. Instead of long articles or endless scrolls, the app serves up small nuggets of knowledge — from Mars missions to forgotten revolutions — one swipe at a time.

With optional text-to-speech and Android Auto support, CurioSwipe can become your on-the-go learning companion.

# README

> **Note:** This project is being used as a learning pad by a beginner (absolute zero experience) in Android app development. All steps, explanations, and troubleshooting are written with that context in mind. 
>
> **Development Context:**
> - Code is developed and executed on a remote Linux (Oracle OCI) VM, accessed via SSH from a Windows laptop running VS Code.
> - The user may want to run the app on a local Android device or emulator on their Windows machine, not on the remote Linux box.
>
> Please provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for every next action, considering this setup.
