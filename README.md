# 🧠 CurioSwipe

**Discover one swipe at a time.**  
CurioSwipe is a curiosity-first Android app that presents bite-sized, thought-provoking topics based on your interests and context — perfect for your commute or spare moments.

## 🎯 Purpose

CurioSwipe is designed to make learning frictionless and fun. Instead of long articles or endless scrolls, the app serves up small nuggets of knowledge — from Mars missions to forgotten revolutions — one swipe at a time.

With optional text-to-speech and Android Auto support, CurioSwipe can become your on-the-go learning companion.
